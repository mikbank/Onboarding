# GenerateInitials - Azure Function

## Overview

GenerateInitials is an Azure Function that generates unique employee initials based on a given name and stores them in an Azure SQL database. The function employs a retry mechanism to ensure uniqueness while avoiding inappropriate or restricted initials.

## Features

- Generates initials based on multiple strategies.
- Stores generated initials in an Azure SQL database.
- Handles SQL timeout and connection issues with retries.
- Prevents the use of restricted or inappropriate initials.
- Logs execution details for monitoring and debugging.

## Strategies for Initial Generation

The function follows a structured approach to generate initials:

1. First 2 letters of the first name + first 3 letters of the last name.
2. First 3 letters of the first name + first 2 letters of the last name.
3. First 4 letters of the first name + first 1 letter of the last name.
4. First 1 letter of the first name + first 4 letters of the last name.
5. First 5 letters of the first name.
6. First 5 letters of the last name.
7. Combination of first, middle, and last name characters.
8. Another variation including the middle name.
9. A final fallback strategy before failing.
